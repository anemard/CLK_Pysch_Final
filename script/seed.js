        'I believe that all people have dignity, worth, and the right to live life in a way that brings them joy. Our ability to live joyfully can be limited due to imbalances of power in our world (racism, sexism, homophobia). Because of this we often suffer, and suffering left unaddressed can lead to limiting beliefs and behaviors. These behaviors are usually adopted as a matter of necessity to survive, yet they can keep us from being the most authentic and happy version of ourselves. The therapeutic relationship can heal and transform our lives through affirmation, validation and sustained attention on our thoughts, beliefs and behaviors. '
